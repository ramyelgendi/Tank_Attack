# Tank Attack (Java)

This is a tank attack game where the player (tank) has one goal which is to destroy the computer (tower) by firing at it. Both the tank and tower have 3 lives, but the tank dies instantly if it hits a mine while moving. Tank cannot move after firing at the tower, but can move while being fired at to dodge the fire missile.
